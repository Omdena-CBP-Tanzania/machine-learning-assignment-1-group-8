# Step 6: Saving the Final Model and Documentation

Once the best model was identified and interpreted, we finalized the workflow by saving artifacts.

### Artifacts Saved:
- ✅ `best_model.pkl`: Trained version of the top-performing model.
- ✅ Markdown insight files:
  - `step3_feature_engineering.md`
  - `step4_model_development.md`
  - `step5_interpretation.md`
  - This file!

### Why This Matters:
Saving the model allows for:
- Reuse in future inference pipelines
- Sharing with collaborators
- Consistency in deployment or API integration

Markdown documentation ensures the project remains reproducible and understandable by others.
